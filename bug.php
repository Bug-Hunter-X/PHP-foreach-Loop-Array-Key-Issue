This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using `foreach` loops.  The issue arises when relying on the numeric index of an array during iteration, particularly when dealing with arrays that have gaps in their numeric keys.

```php
<?php
$myArray = array(
    0 => 'apple',
    2 => 'banana',
    4 => 'cherry'
);

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
    // Incorrect assumption that keys are consecutive
    echo "Next key (incorrect): " . ($key + 1) . "\n";
}
?>
```

This will output:
```
Key: 0, Value: apple
Next key (incorrect): 1
Key: 2, Value: banana
Next key (incorrect): 3
Key: 4, Value: cherry
Next key (incorrect): 5
```

Notice that the assumption of consecutive keys is wrong. Attempting to access the array using `$myArray[$key + 1]` would result in `undefined offset` errors in some cases.
