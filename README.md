# PHP foreach Loop Array Key Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using `foreach` loops in PHP to iterate over arrays with non-consecutive numeric keys.  The code attempts to access subsequent array elements based on an assumption of consecutive keys, which leads to errors.

The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The issue is explained in detail within the files and the accompanying JSON file.  This is a useful example to illustrate the importance of careful key handling when working with PHP arrays.
